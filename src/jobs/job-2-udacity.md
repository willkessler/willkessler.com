I helped orchestrate the acquisition of
**[CloudLabs](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/terminal-com)**
by **[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)**, and integrated its
engineering team into Udacity’s organization. My team launched Udacity’s
advanced Workspaces (in-browser virtual compute environments), as well
as its new modern Content Management System “Mocha”.

**Team**: 12 engs, 2 PMs, 2 designers.
