**[Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)** is the world's leading database
of startup information: companies, products, fundings, investors,
entrepreneurs, and news.

I hired, coached and co-managed the team for four months to drive to
the April 2014 CrunchBase relaunch with an entirely new
codebase/design.  After successful launch, we leveraged our
graph-database technology in features like Graph Insights, Advanced
Search, and the Investor Leaderboard.

These launches led to Crunchbase's spinoff from AOL into a
venture-funded private company. __If you use Crunchbase today, you are probably using systems my team built._

**Team**: 9 engineers, 1 devops, 1 QA
