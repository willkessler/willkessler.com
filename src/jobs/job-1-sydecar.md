#### 30,000 foot view

I built **[Sydecar](https://www.sydecar.io/)’s** products from the ground up, beginning in April 2021. 

Sydecar’s private-equity platform massively accelerates the fundraising process for deal sponsors, handling all legal, banking, tax filing, and investor communication needs. Instead of getting bogged down by details, sponsors can focus on building relationships, thanks to Sydecar’s super efficient, highly vetted and automated platform.

In 2023, Sydecar’s products realized $XXM ARR, with a large profit margin, and the company is on track to quintuple revenues in 2024.

#### Sydecar's Products

- Sydecar’s [Core web application](https://www.sydecar.io/spv) has closed over a thousand strategic investments, moving nearly $XXB of capital from XX,000+ investors.
- Its venture fund product, [Fund+](https://www.sydecar.io/fund+),  has attracted a large number of unique venture funds investing in hundreds of SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles).
- In parallel, Sydecar’s fully enabled [Enterprise API](http://api-docs.sydecar.io) has been integrated headlessly by five corporate clients, along with a rapid on-boarding system enabled by Google Sheets.

#### Behind the scenes

My team built:

1. A GAAP-compliant **custom ledger system**.
> _This custom ledger empowers the company to deliver tax returns and financial reports months ahead of any of our competitors_
2. We implemented a **full-featured internal operations panel**.
> _Thanks to the panel’s job assignment workflow system, as well as our extensive automation, Sydecar’s customer experience team reliably meets its extremely demanding customer SLA’s and growth in deal volume, despite being ten times smaller than our largest competitors’ teams._

#### Building the team

To ship all of these products, I hired and managed: 
* 15 fullstack developers
* 2 PMs 
* 2 EMs
* 1 devops engineer
* 3 QA engineers

My “superpower” is my ability to guide teams to highly creative
solutions to complex customer problems.  This grows from a deep
discovery of the customer experience, followed by group ideating and
hands-on prototyping, and finally, formulation of a clear execution
plan. Continually listening to the team's needs during build is key,
leading to a melding of "what the customer *actually* needs" with
"what can we build that's just *way* *better*."
